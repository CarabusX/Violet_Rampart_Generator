VERSION 1.5 (WIP)

Map geometry and terrain:
-- Increased ground hardness slighty (by about 25%).
-- Decreased slope of center ramps slightly (by about 10%) so they are more pathable by tanks even when deformed.

Resources:
-- Replaced center Geo spot with +4M metal spot (because noone built the Geo anyway). Appears only on maps with 6 or more bases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.4

Graphics:
- Made gray terrain 20% brighter.
- Fixed gray terrain and minimap appearing completely black in LOS view mode.

Map geometry and terrain:
- Added new terrain geometry for map center (lower terrain with ramps).
- Dynamically increase width of lanes between bases the more bases there is, to make more room for armies moving around center (only on maps with 6 or more bases).
- Made base entrances slightly less wide (width 600 -> 550) so that they are more useful as last line of defense.
- Made bottom deeper (-150 -> -200) so that it is more costly to build there. (Singu terraform cost about 400m -> 550m)
- Removed move-speed penalty on bottom terrain so that it is more suited to be used for bridges etc.
- Decreased ground hardness so that it is actually deformable by large explosions.

Resources:
- Added single Geo spot at map center (only on maps with 6 or more bases).

Other:
- Fixed rare issue where base "A" would be second from the top clock-wise, instead of the first.
- Changed minimap label to not contain word "Random" as it confused some people. Changed minimap label color.

VERSION 1.1 (FIX)
- Add minimap to the compiled .smf file so it correctly displays minimap in SpringFiles and Lobby.
